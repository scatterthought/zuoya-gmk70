# zuoya-gmk70
I've created this repository to house the GMK70 firmware and JSON files. I downloaded the firmware from zuoya.top in April 2025, and I can't remember if I got the JSON from there or from somewhere else.

USE THESE FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK. I have made no modifications to them and am not responsible for any issues arising from your use of them. I'm just sharing them so that other Zuoya GMK70 users will be able to configure their keyboards.
